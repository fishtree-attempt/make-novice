> * Advantages of automated build tools such as Make.

Automated build tools such as Make can help us in a number of
ways. They help us to automate repetitive commands and, so, save us
time and reduce the risk of us making errors we might make if running
these commands manually.

They can also save time by ensuring that automatically-generated
artefacts (such as data files or plots) are only recreated when the
files that were used to create these have changed in some way.

Through their notion of targets, dependencies and actions they serve
as a form of documentation, recording dependencies between code,
scripts, tools, configurations, raw data, derived data, plots and
papers.

> Add new rules, update existing rules, and add new macros to:
> 
> * Create `.jpg` files from `.dat` files using `plotcount.py`.
> * Add the script and `.jpg` files to the archive.
> * Remove all auto-generated files (`.dat`, `.jpg`,
>   `analysis.tar.gz`). 

The following figure shows the dependencies involved in building the `analysis.tar.gz` target, once we've added support for images:
