# make-novice

Makefile visualisations in [img](./img) are created using [makefile2graph](https://github.com/lindenb/makefile2graph), this is assumed to be in the `PATH`. See [Makefile](./Makefile)'s `pngs` target. Note that for `07-functions.png` and `08-conclusion-challenge.png` the images should be manually cropped after creation  to remove a `Makefile` node, which denotes the `config.mk` file imported by the Makefiles for these examples.
