## Parallel execution

Make can build dependencies in parallel sub-processes, via its `-j`
flag which specifies the number of sub-processes to use e.g.

~~~ {.bash}
$ make -j 4 analysis.tar.gz
~~~

For more information see the GNU Make manual chapter on [Parallel
Execution](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Parallel.html).

## Make and reproducible research

Blog articles and tutorials on automating data analysis using Make:

* [minimal make](http://kbroman.org/minimal_make/) by Karl Broman. A
  minimal tutorial on using Make with R and LaTeX to automate data
  analysis, visualisation and paper preparation. This page has links
  to Makefiles for many of his papers. 
* [Why Use Make](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/make/) by Mike Bostock. An
  example of using Make to download and convert data. 
* [Makefiles for R/LaTeX
  projects](http://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/makefiles/) by Rob
  Hyndman. Another example of using Make with R and LaTeX. 
* [GNU Make for Reproducible Data Analysis](http://zmjones.com/make/)
  by Zachary Jones. Using Make with Python and LaTeX. 
* Shaun Jackman's [Using Make to increase Automation &
  Reproducibility](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_F5f0qi-aEc)
  lesson, and accompanying
  [example](https://github.com/sjackman/makefile-example).
